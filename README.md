# Welcome to my personal portfolio!

This is where I upload projects I find interesting that I do in my spare time. They mostly revolve around networking and satellites. This is a new initiative as of 2025, so there's not much to show yet. Completed and planned projects are shown below. Enjoy!

## My Projects

### Networking
* [x] Locating Rogue SSIDs with Kismet

### Satellites
* [ ] Building a Quadrifilar Helix Antenna for Satellite Telemetry
* [ ] Grabbing Weather Images from Satellites with GQRX and SatDump
